You can change the look and feel of the app by changing the items in this

From here you can change things like the base, primary color palette,
 background, default card background etc.

    You can use the color picker provided or use your own
    [css][css-background-property] if you like. For example, the following
    will grab an image from unsplash with any image containing the word space:
    `url(https://source.unsplash.com/1920x1080/?space)`
