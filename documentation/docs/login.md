# Account creation and login

This screen communicates with the API to log in the the user and get the
config. Once this is done, the login will be remembered automatically.
(If you clear your cookies/cache or recreate the app,
you will need to login or create a new account again)

You will need to authenticate the app on login to Home Assistant using one of
the users you have setup on Home Assistant.

## Create Account

On your first run of the app, you will be presented with an account creation screen.
