# Custom Themes

This section covers creating custom themes in the config.

Start by adding an array called `custom` under the `theme` object in the
 config or use the [template][template].

```json
  "theme": {
    "custom": [
        "name": "My Theme",
        "base": "dark",
        "overrides": {

        }
    ]
  }
```

## name

The name of your theme

## base

The theme to use as this theme's base. Start with either `light` or `dark` and
 expand from there

## overrides

This is where you edit the theme. Here is a table of all parts of the theme
 that can be overridden/configured. Replace the dots (.) with an object.
 (`"backgrounds": { ... }`)

| Item                             | What this configures/overrides                                                                                                                                       |

## Colors

To set the color you can use any color using the hex value, Material colors or
 even images for backgrounds.

### Material Color

To use Material colors, you can use the [Material Design Pallette][md-color]
 to find the color you want, then using them like so:

```json
            "main": "blueGrey[500]",
```

See how `Blue Grey` becomes camel-cased as `blueGrey`. The `[500]` is the
 exact color. This would result in `#607D8B`.

### Hexadecimal color

You can use hexadecimal values to set colors using the usual `#RRGGBB` format.

### Image

For backgrounds, you can set an image for the background if you like.
 The only caveat to this is that you have to use css formatting.

To add an image set it as a `url` like so:

```json
"main": "url(https://images.pexels.com/photos/4827/nature-forest-trees-fog.jpeg)",
```

Make sure to put the url in brackets like the above.
